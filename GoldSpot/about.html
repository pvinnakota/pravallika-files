Parle sold Gold Spot along with Thums Up, Limca, Citra and Maaza to Coca-Cola in 1993 (which had just relaunched in the Indian market), reportedly for $40 million. In spite of its wide popularity, Gold Spot was withdrawn by Coke from the market in order to re-make space for Coca-Cola's Fanta brand.Gold Spot's slogan was "The Zing Thing."As per data available from the Ministry of Food Processing Industries of India (MoFPI), Gold Spot had a 2% market share during the years 2009 - 10 among all soft drink companies (cola + non-cola drink manufacturers).</p>

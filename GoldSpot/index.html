          <p>Thums Up is a brand of cola in India. The logo is a red thumbs up. It was introduced in 1977 to offset the withdrawal of The Coca-Cola Company from India. The brand was later bought by Coca-Cola who re-launched it in order to compete against Pepsi.

As of February 2012, Thums Up is the leader in the cola segment in India, commanding approximately 42% market share and an overall 15% market share in the Indian aerated waters market. </p>

          <h2>Limca</h2>
          <p>Limca is a lemon and lime flavoured carbonated soft drink made primarily in India and certain parts of the U.S. It contains 60 calories per can. 1 can of Limca is 150ml. No fruit added. Contains permitted artificial flavors.

In an interview in 2008, Ramesh Chauhan of Parle revealed that he had approached the owners of Duke's Lemonade, requesting them to share the formula for the drink with the promise not to make it in India, which was turned down. Chauhan decided to come up with his own formula, which he launched under the Limca brand in 1977.

In 1992, when the Indian government allowed Coca-Cola to return for operations, at the same time as it admitted Pepsi for the first time, Coca-Cola bought local soft-drink (soda) brands, from Parle Agro owner Ramesh Chauhan including Limca, Thums Up (a cola-like drink), Maaza (a mango-juice based drink), Citra (a clear lemon-lime drink), and Gold Spot (Orange flavour).

Prior to 1988 the original formula of Limca contained brominated vegetable oil (BVO). After worldwide reports of ill effects of BVO - the use of BVO in soft drinks was banned in India. As a result of this ban - the formula for Limca was changed and BVO was removed from the concentrate for Limca.</p>
